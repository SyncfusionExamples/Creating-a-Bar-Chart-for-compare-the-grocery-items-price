# Creating-a-Bar-Chart-for-compare-the-grocery-items-price
In this section, we'll delve into a detailed comparison of grocery item prices in the United States and the United Kingdom. To make this analysis more accessible and informative, we'll be utilizing the power of the [.NET MAUI Syncfusion Horizontal Bar graph](https://help.syncfusion.com/maui/cartesian-charts/barchart).

The Horizontal Bar graph is an excellent tool for visualizing data in a way that allows for easy comparisons between different categories. In our case, we'll be visualizing a pyramid bar graph, which is a visually striking way to showcase and compare prices of various grocery items in US and UK countries.

 To render bar chart, initialize the [SfCartesianChart](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html?tabs=tabid-1) and switch the chart X and Y axes by using the [IsTransposed](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/maui/Syncfusion.Maui.Charts.SfCartesianChart.html#Syncfusion_Maui_Charts_SfCartesianChart_IsTransposedProperty) property as true.
